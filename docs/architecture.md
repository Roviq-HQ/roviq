## Key Design Decisions

### Multi-Tenancy: RLS over Schema-per-Tenant

- PostgreSQL Row Level Security on all tenant-scoped tables
- `app.current_tenant_id` session variable set via `withTenant()` helper
- Policy-based admin bypass: `roviq_admin` does NOT have `BYPASSRLS`. Instead, policies explicitly grant `roviq_admin` access via `FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true)`.
- `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on every table — without it, the table owner bypasses policies silently.
- `institutes` table has custom RLS: `roviq_app` gets SELECT only (read own institute), `roviq_reseller` gets FOR ALL (GRANTs limit to SELECT + INSERT + UPDATE), `roviq_admin` gets full access.

### Platform vs Tenant Tables

- **Platform-level (custom RLS):** `users`, `institutes`, `institute_groups`, `resellers` — have per-role policies instead of tenant-scoped policies
- **Tenant-scoped (RLS via `tenantPolicies()`):** `memberships`, `profiles`, `roles`, `refresh_tokens`, `student_guardians`, `academic_years`, `standards`, `sections`, `subjects`, `institute_branding`, `institute_configs`, `institute_identifiers`, `institute_affiliations`, and all business data
- Membership links User↔Institute. One user can have memberships in multiple institutes.

### Three DB Contexts

- **`withTenant(db, tenantId, fn)`**: sets `SET LOCAL ROLE roviq_app` + `app.current_tenant_id`. Used for institute-scope operations.
- **`withReseller(db, resellerId, fn)`**: sets `SET LOCAL ROLE roviq_reseller` + `app.current_reseller_id`. Used for reseller-scope operations.
- **`withAdmin(db, fn)`**: sets `SET LOCAL ROLE roviq_admin`. Used for platform admin operations and cross-tenant queries.
- `withTrash` no longer exists — soft-delete visibility moved to the application layer (see "Soft-Delete via Live Views" below).

### Soft-Delete via Live Views

- Every soft-deletable table (every table that spreads `tenantColumns` / `entityColumns`) has a corresponding `<table>_live` PostgreSQL view created `WITH (security_invoker = true)`. The view body is `SELECT * FROM <table> WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`.
- `security_invoker` is critical: it makes the view evaluate RLS as the **calling** DB role (`roviq_app`/`roviq_reseller`/`roviq_admin`) instead of the view owner. Without it, an `roviq_app` connection would read every tenant's rows because RLS would evaluate as the owner. PG 15+ supports it; PG 18 inlines the view with the underlying partial index for free.
- Views are declared in `libs/database/src/schema/live-views.ts` via `pgView('<table>_live').as((qb) => qb.select().from(<table>).where(isNull(<table>.deletedAt)))` and exported as `<table>Live` (e.g. `subjectsLive`, `studentProfilesLive`).
- **Read** through the view: `tx.select().from(subjectsLive)`. **Write** to the base table: `tx.insert(subjects)…`, `tx.update(subjects)…`, `softDelete(tx, subjects, id)`.
- RLS policies are now **tenant-only** (`tenantPolicies()` and `entityPolicies()` no longer carry `deleted_at IS NULL`). The previous `*_app_select_trash` policies and `app.include_deleted` toggle were removed; their behaviour collapses into "query the base table directly with `isNotNull(deletedAt)`" for trash listings.
- CI guard: `pnpm check:live-views` (script at `scripts/check-live-views.ts`) fails when application code reads a soft-deletable base table outside `__tests__/`. Annotate intentional admin/break-glass cases with `// allow-base-read: <reason>`.
- Schema-side CI guards: `pnpm check:live-views-coverage` (`scripts/check-live-views-coverage.ts`) walks every `pgTable` in `libs/database/src/schema/` and `ee/libs/database/src/schema/` and fails when a soft-deletable table (spreads `tenantColumns`/`entityColumns` or declares `deletedAt:`) has no matching `<table>Live` export in `live-views.ts`. `pnpm check:rls-coverage` (`scripts/check-rls-coverage.ts`) fails when a `pgTable` definition lacks any RLS indicator (`tenantPolicies`/`entityPolicies`/`pgPolicy` + `.enableRLS()`); platform-level user tables governed by DB-role GRANTs + CASL are listed in `RLS_EXEMPT_BASENAMES`.

### CASL Authorization

- Role abilities stored as JSON in the `roles` table, cached in Redis (5min TTL)
- Per-membership ability overrides in `memberships.abilities` field
- Condition placeholders (`${user.id}`, `${user.tenantId}`) resolved at request time
- Same `AppAction`/`AppSubject` types shared between backend and frontend via `@roviq/common-types`

### NestJS Build: @nx/js:tsc (not webpack)

- NestJS apps use `@nx/js:tsc` executor for builds
- Next.js apps use Turbopack via `@nx/next/plugin`
- No webpack anywhere in the workspace

### GraphQL Schema: In-Memory

- `autoSchemaFile: true` — schema generated in memory, no file written to disk
- Avoids file watcher loops with NX dev server

### Event Architecture

- **EventBusService**: publishes to both NATS JetStream (for cross-service) and GraphQL PubSub (for subscriptions) in a single `emit()` call
- **GraphQL Subscriptions**: 8 subscriptions across 3 scopes with tenant/reseller filtering via `graphql-ws`
- **Temporal**: used for long-running workflows (institute setup pipeline, audit partition management)
- **JetStream retention**: every business stream uses `workqueue` retention so each message is dispatched to exactly one durable handler. The `NOTIFICATION` stream is the single exception — it uses `interest` retention because two consumers need the same `NOTIFICATION.user.created` event (welcome-email listener on the exact subject + Novu-subscriber-sync listener on the `NOTIFICATION.user.*` wildcard), which workqueue retention rejects as overlapping filters. `interest` fans out to every bound consumer and retains each message until all have acked. Stream config lives in `libs/backend/nats-jetstream/src/streams/stream.config.ts`.

### Service Layer Rules

- Services ONLY talk to repositories — never import `DRIZZLE_DB`, `withAdmin`, or Drizzle tables
- Services return repository `Record` types — GraphQL handles mapping via `@ObjectType` decorators
- Each status transition is a named domain mutation (`suspend()`, not `updateStatus('SUSPENDED')`)
- `BusinessException` with `ErrorCode` enum for all business errors (not generic `BadRequestException`)

### Field Resolver Pattern: scope-specific joins without duplicating ObjectTypes

When a query in one scope (e.g., admin) needs extra joined fields on a shared `@ObjectType` (e.g., `InstituteModel`), use a scope-specific `@ResolveField` resolver class instead of creating a parallel `AdminInstituteModel`. This avoids duplicating the full ObjectType while keeping cross-scope contamination impossible.

**Two resolver layers on `InstituteModel`:**

- **`InstituteFieldResolver`** — `@UseGuards(GqlAuthGuard)`, all authenticated scopes. Exposes lazy join fields: `branding`, `config`, `identifiers`, `affiliations`.
- **`AdminInstituteFieldResolver`** — `@UseGuards(GqlAuthGuard, PlatformScopeGuard)`, platform admin only. Exposes `resellerName` and `groupName`, batched via DataLoader to eliminate N+1.

**N+1 protection via request-scoped DataLoader:**

`AdminInstituteLoaders` is registered as `@Injectable({ scope: Scope.REQUEST })`. A new instance is constructed per GraphQL request; all `.load(id)` calls within the same request batch into at most 2 extra DB round-trips regardless of page size.

```text
AdminInstituteFieldResolver
  └─ injects AdminInstituteLoaders (Scope.REQUEST)
       ├─ resellerName DataLoader → SELECT id, name FROM resellers WHERE id = ANY($1)
       └─ groupName   DataLoader → SELECT id, name FROM institute_groups WHERE id = ANY($1)
```

**Rule:** Field-only resolver classes (no `@Query`/`@Mutation`/`@Subscription`) are exempt from the scope-guard meta-test — they inherit auth from the parent query. The meta-test uses `declaresRootOperations()` to distinguish them from root resolvers.

### Per-role primary nav

The bottom tab bar and per-portal `defaultSlugs` fallback (see
[frontend.md](frontend.md#responsive-layout--bottom-tab-bar)) are backed by a
small GraphQL surface owned by the Identity Service module group:

- **`Role.primaryNavSlugs: [String!]!`** — curated symbolic slugs for the role.
  Empty list means "use the portal's `defaultSlugs`".
- **`me.primaryNavSlugs: [String!]`** — convenience field on the auth payload;
  resolves to the active membership's role's `primaryNavSlugs` so the web app
  can build the bottom tab bar without a second round-trip.
- **`instituteRoles: [Role!]!`** — `@InstituteScope`, CASL `read Role`. Lists
  all roles in the current tenant for the customization UI.
- **`updateRolePrimaryNav(input: { roleId, slugs }): Role!`** — `@InstituteScope`,
  CASL `update Role`. Validates `slugs.length <= MAX_PRIMARY_NAV_SLUGS` (4),
  uniqueness, and that every entry is a member of `NAV_SLUGS` (from
  `@roviq/common-types`).

Storage is `roles.primary_nav_slugs jsonb` (default `'[]'::jsonb`); the column
was added in migration `20260429031547_stormy_dragon_lord`. Decoupling the
persisted slug from the route/icon/label keeps URL refactors out of the DB —
a renamed page only updates the per-portal `navRegistry`.

### Institute Service

See `docs/institute-service.md` for full documentation of the institute module including schema, resolvers, RLS, events, and Temporal workflow.

### Attendance, Leaves & Holidays

See `docs/features/attendance.md` for the full attendance + leaves + holidays pipeline — schema, RLS, modules, GraphQL surface, events, integrations, the permissions matrix, and the same-day edit window / admin override semantics.

## Date & timezone contract

| Layer | Format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL storage | `date` (YYYY-MM-DD) / `timestamptz` (RFC 3339 UTC) | Drizzle maps `date` ↔ `string`, `timestamp` ↔ `Date` |
| GraphQL wire | `DateOnly` scalar (YYYY-MM-DD) / `DateTime` scalar (RFC 3339) | `graphql-scalars` `GraphQLLocalDate` / `GraphQLDateTimeISO` |
| Frontend display | Indian locale (DD/MM/YYYY) via `useFormatDate()` from `@roviq/i18n` | Never format in resolvers or services |
| Institute-timezone calendar | `getInstituteToday(institute)` from `apps/api-gateway/src/common/timezone` (API-gateway-internal) | Falls back to `Asia/Kolkata` |

**The DD/MM footgun**: India displays DD/MM/YYYY. ISO stores YYYY-MM-DD. These must never be confused — store ISO, parse ISO, display via hook. A display string must never be re-parsed as a date.
